# Switch Energy Supplier

There are various energy suppliers that manufacturers are able to choose from, all with varying rates of electricity supply. Business energy supply rates can be compared [here](https://www.energizect.com/rate-board/compare-energy-supplier-rates?customerClass=1206&monthlyUsage=2000&planTypeEdc=1191). It is important to note that this rate board is for CT manufacturers only, for assessments performed in other states, the energy rate board for that state should be used. Client's are a good candidate for changing their electricity supplier if their supply rate is greater than about $0.11/kWh, it is important to note that the supply rate of the client **is not** the blended supply rate which is used for report writing. The true supply rate of the client must be found directly in the utility bills.
