# Don't Pay Late Fees

Manufacturers can incur late fees for a variety of reasons, including insufficient cash flow or missed payment deadlines. These represent needless expenses and should be avoided when possible.

**ARC Code(s):** 2.8123

## Savings Calculation

To calculate the savings from this recommendation, sum all late fees from each bill in the utility analysis. In addition to the grand total across all accounts, report the total for each utility type separately (e.g., total electricity late fees, total natural gas late fees).

## Anticipated Costs

Because there are no required equipment purchases or additional labor, the anticipated costs for this recommendation are $0. The payback period is therefore immediate.

## Report Requirements

In addition to the [typical report requirements](../how-to.md) and the recommendation-specific savings and costs, the recommendation should include a table of all late fees charged. The table should follow this structure:

- **Column 1:** Month (formatted as three-letter abbreviation, hyphen, year; e.g., Mar-2024)
- **Columns 2+:** One column for each utility account that includes late fees, labeled by utility type and account if necessary (e.g., "Electricity - Main," "Natural Gas")
- **Final Column:** Total late fees for that month

Include rows at the bottom for both the subtotal for each account and the grand total across all accounts.
