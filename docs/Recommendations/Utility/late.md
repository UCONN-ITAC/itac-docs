**ARC Code(s):** 2.8123


## Savings Calculation

To calculate the savings from this recommendation, the late fees from each bill in the utility analysis must be totaled. In addition to the total across all accounts, the total for each type of account should also be reported (i.e. total electricity late fees, etc). 

## Anticipated Costs

Because there are no required equipment purchases or additional labor required, the anticipated costs for this recommendation are $0. Thus, the payback period is automaticlaly immediate. 

## Report Requirements

In addition to the [typical report requirements](../how-to.md) and the recommendation-specific savings and costs, the recommendation should include a table of all late fees charged. This table should list the months in the first column. There should then be another column for each utility account that includes late fees. At the bottom of the table, there should be rows for both the total for each account and the grand total. An example of this table formatting is available in the example recommendation.
