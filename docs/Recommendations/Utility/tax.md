# Don't Pay Sales Tax on Utility Purchases

In Connecticut (and other states, qualification must be researched), manufacturers who use at least 75% of their utility consumption for manufacturing or fabrication are able to purchase their electricity tax free. More specific information can be found [here](https://ics-tax.com/utility-sales-tax-exemption/connecticut-utility-sales-tax-exemption/#:~:text=Connecticut%20offers%20a%20sales%20tax,to%20clearly%20measure%20qualifying%20consumption.).

### Identifying Where the Recommendation is Applicable

It is a safe bet that any manufacturer who is requesting an energy assessment from ITAC is using >75% of their utility consumption for qualifying activities, what is important to identify before writing this recommendation is if they have already claimed this exemption. To identify if the client pays sales tax on their utilities, we need to reference the utility bills provided. Below is an example from an Eversource electricity bill, if the client pays taxes on their bills, there will be some sort of provision outlining the taxes that they pay. If there is no mention of sales tax in the bill, then it is likely they do not pay this.

### Methodology for Calculation

Cost savings associated with not paying sales tax is calculated as the total of sales tax that the client paid in the 12 month period of utility bills provided. To identify these payments, the Utility Analysis sheet which outlines all of the utility bills of the client in Excel can be used. The sales tax paid on utility accounts is usually one of the last few lines of the bill before the total.

**Important:** It is important that sales tax payments on **all** utility accounts are accounted for. Before finalizing calculations, verify that all accounts have been investigated for sales tax. Clients often have multiple electricity or gas accounts, as well as may pay tax on certain accounts but not others.

For example, if the client paid $500 a month, for each of the 12 months in the utility analysis, their yearly savings from sales tax exemption would be $500 x 12 = **$6,000**. 

### Payback Period

For this recommendation the payback period is **immediate** as implementing this recommendation requires a simple clerical adjustment.
