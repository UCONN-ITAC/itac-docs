# Reallocate Labor Through Production Automation

Installing automation equipment to replace manual production tasks frees dedicated operators for reallocation to value-added work elsewhere in the facility. Savings represent recovered productive capacity — labor hours that are currently consumed by repetitive manual tasks and can be redirected once the process is automated.

**ARC Code(s):**

## Background / How It Works

Many manufacturing facilities still rely on manual operators for tasks that are strong candidates for automation: part handling, machine tending, material transfer, inspection, and packaging. These stations often require dedicated personnel for the duration of a production shift, tying up labor that could be deployed on higher-value activities.

Manual stations also carry ergonomic risks. Repetitive motion injuries force operator rotation schemes that reduce scheduling flexibility and can increase training overhead. Automating these stations eliminates the ergonomic exposure and frees the associated labor hours.

This measure does not assume headcount reduction. The operator is reassigned to other production work within the facility, so savings represent recovered productive capacity rather than a payroll decrease. If the facility does choose to reduce headcount, the same dollar value applies but should be characterized as a labor cost reduction rather than a reallocation.

!!! note "Energy Savings"
    While automation cells consume electricity, the incremental energy impact for a single cell is generally not significant enough to quantify separately. If the automation displaces an energy-intensive existing process (e.g., replacing pneumatic actuators with all-electric servo drives across many stations), evaluate the energy savings as a separate custom recommendation.

## Savings Calculation

### Annual Labor Savings

Annual productivity savings equal the operator's fully burdened hourly rate multiplied by the annual hours currently spent at the manual station:

$$
\text{Annual Savings} = R_{\text{labor}} \times H_{\text{station}}
$$

Where:

- $R_{\text{labor}}$ = fully burdened labor rate including fringe benefits ($/hr)
- $H_{\text{station}}$ = annual operator hours at the manual station (hrs/yr)

The fully burdened rate should include base wages, health insurance, retirement contributions, payroll taxes, and other fringe benefits. If the facility does not provide a burdened rate, apply a fringe multiplier of 1.3–1.4 to the base hourly wage.

If a station requires partial operator attention (e.g., one operator tending two machines), prorate $H_{\text{station}}$ to reflect only the fraction of time that is recoverable through automation.


### No Energy Savings

No energy savings are claimed under this measure. Record "--" in the energy savings columns of the recommendation summary table.

## Anticipated Costs

Automation costs are highly project-specific. Document each major cost component in the recommendation. This seems really hard to do accurately. It is. Your goal here is to be plausibly right and not absolutely wrong. Facilities can usually provide a BOM of what they plan to purchase for automation, or their too early in the process to know. In the latter case, you can use the following as a rough guide:

**Equipment:** Itemize each piece of automation equipment with its estimated cost. Typical components include:

- Industrial robotic arms and controllers
- End-of-arm tooling (EOAT) — grippers, vacuum cups, or custom fixtures
- Conveyors — indexing, over/under, belt, or roller types
- Vision systems and sensors for part detection or quality inspection
- Guarding, safety interlocks, and light curtains
- Robot stands, mounting hardware, and cable management

**Integration:** Professional integration services cover system design, programming, installation, and commissioning. Budget separately from the equipment purchase.

**In-house labor:** Electrical work, structural fabrication, concrete pads, utility connections, and any other facility modifications performed by in-house trades. Include these costs because they consume facility resources that would otherwise be deployed elsewhere.

## Report Requirements

In addition to the [typical report requirements](../how-to.md), the recommendation must include:

- **Current process description** — what the operator does at the manual station, including cycle times and any ergonomic or safety concerns driving the recommendation
- **Number of operators reallocated** — the headcount freed by the automation, with justification (full-time dedicated vs. partial attention)
- **Fully burdened labor rate** — the hourly rate used in the savings calculation, with a breakdown of base wage and fringe components if available
- **Annual hours at station** — the number of operator-hours per year currently consumed by the manual task
- **Equipment list and cost breakdown** — itemized list of all automation components, integration services, and installation labor with individual costs
