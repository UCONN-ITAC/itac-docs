# Introduction

Welcome to the Southern New England ITAC documentation.

This site serves as a centralized hub for all ITAC employees. It contains information related to the operations and procedures of the Southern New England ITAC and is intended to function as a reference guide.

The University of Connecticut Industrial Assessment Center (UC-ITAC) provides free energy, productivity, and waste assessments to small and medium-sized industrial facilities through funding provided by the United States Department of Energy. More detailed information on the impact of our work can be found here:  [UC ITAC Impact Overview](https://itac.university/center/university-of-connecticut)

If you have any questions that are not answered in this documentation, please reach out to the Student Lead of the ITAC.

   Work tickets are assigned here. All assessment data, targets, future plans, and historical work are stored in Airtable. This is the primary hub for your assigned tasks.

## Need to Know Information

The ITAC has multiple internal websites and tools designed to improve efficiency. If you identify a workflow that could be improved through an application or website, discuss it with the Director or Student Lead. A solution may already exist, or one may be developed if the issue affects multiple employees.
