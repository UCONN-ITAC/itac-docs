# Conclusion

## Module Summary

This module established the fundamental knowledge base for all ITAC energy assessment work. You've learned to work fluently with both electrical and thermal units, interpret commercial utility bills, apply thermodynamic principles to analyze equipment, calculate heat transfer, and understand fluid mechanics principles that govern motor-driven systems.

### Key Takeaways by Topic

**Power and Energy:** You learned the foundational units used throughout energy work: electrical power (kW) versus energy (kWh), thermal power (MMBtu/hr) versus energy (MMBtu), and the conversion factor linking them (1 kWh = 3,412 BTU). These units and conversions appear in every energy calculation you'll perform.

**Utilities:** Commercial electricity billing involves both consumption charges (\$/kWh for energy used) and demand charges (\$/kW for peak power). Ratchet clauses can extend the impact of a single demand spike across many months. Power factor penalties charge facilities for inefficient use of electrical capacity. Natural gas billing is generally simpler (volume-based), while delivered fuels like propane and fuel oil require reconstructing consumption from delivery records.

**Thermodynamics:** The First Law (energy balance) allows you to analyze equipment performance and identify losses. Latent heat dominates phase change processes, making steam systems efficient for heat transfer and making condensate return valuable. Efficiency definitions matter: combustion efficiency measures stack losses, thermal efficiency includes all equipment losses, and system efficiency accounts for distribution and utilization. The Second Law explains why you cannot recover all waste heat (temperature pinch limits heat exchangers) and why refrigeration requires work input (moving heat against its natural direction).

**Heat Transfer:** Conduction through building envelopes and pipe insulation follows Q = A·ΔT/R, where higher R-values reduce heat loss. Convection heat transfer depends on surface area, temperature difference, and the convection coefficient; fouling reduces heat exchanger performance by adding thermal resistance. Radiation becomes significant at high temperatures (above 200°F) and follows the Stefan-Boltzmann Law with temperature to the fourth power.

**Fluids:** Pressure drop in piping varies approximately with the inverse fifth power of diameter, making undersized piping extremely energy-intensive for compressed air and pumping systems. The affinity laws explain VFD savings: flow is proportional to speed, pressure to speed squared, and power to speed cubed. This cubic relationship means reducing fan or pump speed by 20% cuts power consumption by nearly 50%.

## Practice Questions

### Question 1: Comparing Energy Sources

A facility is evaluating whether to heat a process using electricity or natural gas. The process requires 15 MMBtu/hr of heat input. Electricity costs $0.10/kWh with an electric resistance heater (100% efficient). Natural gas costs $8.50/MMBtu with a boiler operating at 82% combustion efficiency.

**Part A:** Calculate the hourly operating cost for each option.

**Part B:** If the facility operates this process 5,000 hours per year, calculate the annual energy cost difference between the two options.

**Part C:** The electric utility charges $15/kW for demand. Calculate the monthly demand charge for the electric heating option.

### Question 2: Building Envelope Analysis

A facility has 2,500 ft² of wall area with R-13 insulation and 400 ft² of single-pane windows (R = 1). The facility is heated with natural gas at $10.50/MMBtu through a boiler with 78% thermal efficiency. The heating season averages a 40°F temperature difference between inside and outside for 4,000 hours per year.

**Part A:** Calculate the heat loss rate (BTU/hr) through the walls and through the windows separately.

**Part B:** The facility is considering upgrading windows to double-pane (R = 3). Calculate the reduction in heat loss rate (BTU/hr) from this upgrade.

**Part C:** What percentage of the current envelope heat loss is through windows, despite windows representing only 14% of the envelope area?

### Question 3: Fan System VFD Application

A centrifugal fan operates at 1,800 RPM and delivers 20,000 CFM of airflow while drawing 50 kW of electrical power.

**Part A:** Using the affinity laws, if the fan speed is reduced to 1,440 RPM (80% of original speed), calculate the new airflow rate (CFM).

**Part B:** Calculate the new pressure developed by the fan at 1,440 RPM as a percentage of the original pressure.

**Part C:** Calculate the new power consumption (kW) at 1,440 RPM.

**Part D:** Explain why the power reduction percentage is much larger than the speed reduction percentage.
