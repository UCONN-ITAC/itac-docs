# Introduction

Welcome to Module 1: Basics. This module establishes the foundational knowledge you'll need for all ITAC (Industrial Technical Assistance Consultant) work. Whether you're analyzing compressed air systems, evaluating boiler efficiency, or sizing HVAC equipment, the concepts covered here will form the basis of your calculations and recommendations.

Energy assessment work requires fluency in both electrical and thermal systems, an understanding of how facilities are charged for energy, and the ability to identify losses and inefficiencies. This module builds that foundation systematically, moving from fundamental units and conversions through the physics that governs industrial energy systems.

## Module Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Convert between electrical units (kW, kWh) and thermal units (BTU, MMBtu)
- Interpret commercial utility bills including demand charges, ratchet clauses, and power factor penalties
- Apply the First Law of Thermodynamics to analyze equipment energy balances
- Distinguish between combustion, thermal, and system efficiency
- Calculate heat transfer through conduction, convection, and radiation
- Apply affinity laws to estimate VFD savings on fans and pumps
- Understand how pressure drop affects compressed air and pumping system energy consumption
