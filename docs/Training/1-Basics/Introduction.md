# Introduction

Welcome to Module 1: Basics. This module establishes the foundational knowledge you'll need for all ITAC (Industrial Technical Assistance Consultant) work. Whether you're analyzing compressed air systems, evaluating boiler efficiency, or sizing HVAC equipment, the concepts covered here will form the basis of your calculations and recommendations.

Energy assessment work requires fluency in both electrical and thermal systems, an understanding of how facilities are charged for energy, and the ability to identify losses and inefficiencies. This module builds that foundation systematically, moving from fundamental units and conversions through the physics that governs industrial energy systems.

## Module Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Convert between electrical units (kW, kWh) and thermal units (BTU, MMBtu)
- Interpret commercial utility bills including demand charges, ratchet clauses, and power factor penalties
- Apply the First Law of Thermodynamics to analyze equipment energy balances
- Distinguish between combustion, thermal, and system efficiency
- Calculate heat transfer through conduction, convection, and radiation
- Apply affinity laws to estimate VFD savings on fans and pumps
- Understand how pressure drop affects compressed air and pumping system energy consumption

## Overview

### [Power and Energy](Power-and-Energy.md)

This page covers the fundamental electrical and thermal units used throughout energy assessment work. You'll learn Ohm's Law and electrical power relationships, understand the distinction between power (kW, MMBtu/hr) and energy (kWh, MMBtu), and master the conversions between electrical and thermal units. This is the measurement foundation for everything that follows.

### [Utilities](Utilities.md)

Before you can calculate savings, you need to understand how facilities pay for energy. This page explains commercial electricity billing including consumption and demand charges, ratchet clauses, power factor adjustments, and the breakdown of supply versus delivery charges. You'll also learn how natural gas, fuel oil, and propane are billed and how to compare energy costs across different fuels.

### [Thermodynamics](Thermodynamics.md)

This page covers the thermodynamic principles that govern thermal systems. You'll apply First Law energy balances to boilers, chillers, and heat exchangers, understand the role of latent heat in steam systems and HVAC, learn the distinctions between combustion, thermal, and system efficiency, and grasp Second Law concepts that limit heat recovery and require work input for refrigeration.

### [Heat Transfer](Heat-Transfer.md)

Heat transfer determines how energy moves through building envelopes, process equipment, and heat exchangers. This page covers conduction and R-values for insulation analysis, convection fundamentals and the impact of fouling, and radiation heat transfer for high-temperature equipment. You'll learn to identify heat loss opportunities and understand what limits heat exchanger performance.

### [Fluids](Fluids.md)

Fluid mechanics principles drive the performance and efficiency of compressed air, pumping, and HVAC systems. This page explains pressure drop in piping and its energy implications for compressed air and pumping systems, and teaches the affinity laws that make VFDs on fans and pumps such powerful energy-saving measures. These concepts are among the most frequently applied in ITAC assessments.
