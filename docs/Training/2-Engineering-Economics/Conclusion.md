# Conclusion

## Module Summary

This module established the economic framework for evaluating energy efficiency investments. You've learned to organize cash flows into their constituent elements, understand the time value of money and its implications for project valuation, and calculate payback periods that communicate project economics to decision-makers.

### Key Takeaways

**Cash Flows:** Every recommendation involves four key elements: implementation cost (Year 0 outflow), tax credits and incentives (Year 0 inflow), annual savings (recurring inflow), and recurring costs (recurring outflow). The net implementation cost is what the facility pays after incentives. The net annual cash flow is savings minus recurring costs. Properly organizing these elements sets up all economic analysis and ensures transparent communication with facility managers.

**Time Value of Money and NPV:** A dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future because it can be invested to earn a return. Present value converts future cash flows to their equivalent value today using a discount rate. Net present value (NPV) sums all discounted cash flows to determine whether a project creates value. Positive NPV means the project returns more than the discount rate; negative NPV means it destroys value. While ITAC doesn't calculate NPV for recommendations, understanding this metric helps you recognize how finance departments evaluate your proposals.

**Payback Period:** Simple payback divides net implementation cost by net annual savings, assuming constant cash flows and ignoring the time value of money. It's easy to calculate, verify, and communicate—which is why ITAC uses it. For projects with short payback periods (under 3 years) and constant savings, simple payback adequately captures the economics. For complex projects with varying cash flows or long time horizons, standard payback or discounted payback may be more appropriate, though these are not reported in the ITAC database.

## Practice Questions

### Question 1: Organizing Cash Flows

A facility is considering upgrading its HVAC building management system (BMS). The new BMS will optimize heating and cooling schedules, adjust setpoints based on occupancy, and provide remote monitoring capabilities. Project details:

- BMS equipment and installation: $18,500
- Utility incentive for building controls: $3,200
- Monthly online monitoring service fee: $85/month
- Annual heating cost reduction: $4,800
- Annual cooling cost reduction: $3,600

**Part A:** Calculate the implementation cost and the incentive amount.

**Part B:** Calculate the net implementation cost (Year 0 cash flow).

**Part C:** Calculate the net annual cash flow (Year 1 and beyond).

### Question 2: Time Value of Money and NPV Intuition

Consider two energy efficiency projects, both with net implementation cost of $10,000:

- **Project A:** Saves $4,000 per year for 3 years, then the equipment fails and savings stop.
- **Project B:** Saves $2,000 per year for 10 years.

**Part A:** Calculate the simple payback period for each project.

**Part B:** Calculate the total undiscounted savings over the life of each project (sum of all annual savings).

**Part C:** Without performing the calculation, explain which project would have a higher NPV at a 10% discount rate, and why.

**Part D:** Explain why simple payback period treats these projects differently than NPV does.

### Question 3: Simple Payback Calculation

A manufacturing facility is evaluating a VFD installation on a 75 HP cooling tower fan. The project details are:

- VFD equipment and installation: $8,200
- Utility rebate for motor controls: $50 per HP controlled
- Current annual electricity consumption: 285,000 kWh at $0.11/kWh
- Electricity consumption after VFD installation: 145,000 kWh at $0.11/kWh
- Current annual demand charge: $4,200
- Demand charge after VFD installation: $3,100
- No change in maintenance costs

**Part A:** Calculate the total implementation cost after rebates.

**Part B:** Calculate the annual electricity savings (consumption + demand).

**Part C:** Calculate the simple payback period.

**Part D:** Based on the payback period, would you expect this project to have a positive or negative NPV at a typical industrial discount rate (10-12%)? Explain your reasoning without calculating NPV.
