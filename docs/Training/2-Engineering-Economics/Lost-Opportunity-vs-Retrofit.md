# Lost-Opportunity vs Retrofit

Energy efficiency recommendations fall into two timing categories: **lost-opportunity** and **retrofit**. Understanding this distinction affects how you present the economics and when a facility should act.

## Retrofit Recommendations

A **retrofit** replaces working equipment before the end of its useful life. The facility has already made the capital investment in the existing equipment, and that equipment still functions. You are asking them to discard remaining useful life in exchange for energy savings.

The economic question for a retrofit is straightforward: does the value of energy savings justify abandoning the existing investment?

!!! info "Common Retrofits"

    - Replacing functional T8 fluorescent fixtures with LED
    - Installing VFDs on constant-speed motors that still work
    - Upgrading a working chiller to a high-efficiency model
    - Adding insulation to pipes or walls in existing buildings
    - Repairing leaks in a compressed air system

For retrofits, the full implementation cost (equipment + installation) appears in the payback calculation. The facility pays to remove and replace equipment that otherwise would continue operating.

Retrofits can proceed on any timeline. If a retrofit has a 2-year payback, waiting another 6 months does not fundamentally change the economics. The equipment will still work in 6 months, and the savings opportunity remains.

## Lost-Opportunity Recommendations

A **lost-opportunity** recommendation coincides with a moment when the facility must make a decision anyway. The existing equipment has failed, reached end of life, or the facility is planning new construction or a major renovation. The incremental cost of efficiency is the difference between a standard replacement and a high-efficiency alternative.

The economic question for a lost-opportunity is different: given that you are already spending money, does the incremental efficiency cost justify the savings?

!!! info "Common Lost-Opportunities"

    - Specifying a premium-efficiency motor when replacing a failed motor
    - Installing LED fixtures in new construction instead of standard fluorescent
    - Sizing HVAC equipment correctly during a renovation instead of oversizing
    - Choosing a high-efficiency compressor when the old one fails
    - Installing occupancy sensors during an office remodel

For lost-opportunity recommendations, only the **incremental cost** appears in the economic analysis. A premium-efficiency motor might cost $800 more than a standard-efficiency motor. The facility was already planning to spend money on a motor. The incremental $800 is the relevant economic decision.

!!! example

    A facility's 50 HP motor fails. They will install a replacement either way:

    - Standard-efficiency motor: $3,200 installed
    - Premium-efficiency motor: $4,100 installed
    - **Incremental cost: $900**

    Annual electricity savings from premium efficiency: $480/year

    Simple payback on incremental cost: $900 / $480 = 1.9 years

    If you used the full $4,100 cost, payback would be 8.5 years, dramatically misrepresenting the economics.

Lost-opportunities have urgency. Once the facility installs the standard-efficiency option, the opportunity to capture savings at low incremental cost disappears for 10-20 years (the lifetime of the equipment). 

## Why the Distinction Matters

The lost-opportunity vs retrofit distinction changes both the economic analysis and the communication strategy.

**Economic Analysis:** Use incremental cost for lost-opportunities, full cost for retrofits. Using the wrong cost basis makes projects appear more or less attractive than they actually are.

**Communication:** Lost-opportunities require faster decision-making. When a motor has failed and maintenance staff are sourcing a replacement, you have days to influence the purchase decision. Retrofits can be evaluated on a normal capital budgeting cycle.

**Baseline Assumptions:** For a retrofit, the baseline is the existing equipment continuing to operate. For a lost-opportunity, the baseline is the standard-efficiency replacement the facility would install anyway.

## Identifying Lost-Opportunities

During an ITAC assessment, you identify lost-opportunities by asking about upcoming projects and equipment condition:

- "Are you planning any renovations, expansions, or equipment replacements in the next 12 months?"
- "Which motors or pieces of equipment are approaching end of life?"
- "Have you had any equipment failures recently that you're planning to replace?"

Some lost-opportunities appear during the assessment when you notice equipment that is clearly at end of life. A 40-year-old compressor that cycles constantly and leaks oil is probably months from failure. Recommending a high-efficiency replacement before it catastrophically fails at 2 AM on a Friday positions you as helping the facility plan rather than reacting to emergencies.

## Economic Implications

Lost-opportunities almost always have better economics (shorter payback) than retrofits because the incremental cost is lower than the full replacement cost.

!!! warning 

    Just because something is a lost-opportunity doesn't mean the incremental efficiency investment makes sense. If a high-efficiency chiller costs $45,000 more than a standard chiller and only saves $3,000/year (15-year payback on the increment), clearly communicate that the standard option is likely the better financial choice.
