# Introduction

Welcome to Module 3: Technical Writing. Every energy assessment recommendation, no matter how technically sound, fails if it cannot persuade facility managers to act. This module teaches you to write technical documents that make clear arguments, present data effectively, and drive decision-making.

Technical writing at ITAC is not about creating lengthy reports filled with data. It's about building a case for action. Every recommendation should have a thesis (the facility should do this), evidence (here's why), and a call to action (implement by this date). Reports that simply present information without taking a position get filed and forgotten. Your job is to write reports that get implemented.

## Module Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Write concise, precise, and accurate technical prose
- Construct clear arguments that lead with the main point
- Use active voice appropriately and understand when passive voice serves a purpose
- Eliminate hedging language and vague quantifiers
- Adapt your writing style to different audiences (executive summaries vs. technical sections)
- Select appropriate graph types (line charts, bar charts, pie charts) based on data and purpose
- Design effective visualizations that follow best practices and avoid common mistakes
- Write effective figure and table captions that stand alone
- Recognize and fix common technical writing pitfalls
- Transform weak, vague recommendations into strong, actionable ones
