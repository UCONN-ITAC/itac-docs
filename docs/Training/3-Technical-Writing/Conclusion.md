# Conclusion

## Module Summary

This module established the principles of effective technical writing for energy assessment work. You've learned that technical writing is about making arguments, not transferring information. Every recommendation should be concise (no unnecessary words), precise (specific numbers instead of vague qualifiers), and right (verified and accurate). Strong technical writing leads with the main point, uses active voice strategically, eliminates hedging, and adapts to the audience's technical background.

### Key Takeaways

**Core Principles:** The three words that should guide every sentence are concise, precise, and right. Concise means deleting unnecessary words. Precise means replacing "significant savings" with "47,000 kWh ($5,640) annually." Right means checking calculations, unit conversions, and data sources. These principles separate reports that drive action from reports that get ignored.

**Voice and Argument:** Technical writing should make a clear argument with a defined thesis. Lead with your conclusion rather than burying it under background and methodology. Use active voice for strength and clarity, but recognize that passive voice has legitimate uses when the actor is unknown or unimportant. Never use first person singular ("I recommend"), but collective "we" is acceptable when representing the assessment team.

**Audience Awareness:** Executive summaries must be accessible to non-technical readers and focus on outcomes (cost savings, payback periods) rather than technical details. Technical sections can assume general engineering knowledge but must explain assumptions and methodology clearly enough for another engineer to reproduce your analysis. Adjust your language and level of detail to match the reader's background and needs.

**Figures and Captions:** Every figure and table must support your argument and be referenced in the body text. Captions should be descriptive enough to stand alone—a reader skimming the report should understand what a figure shows without reading surrounding text. Weak captions just label ("Figure 3: Boiler data"); strong captions explain what the data reveals ("Figure 3: Boiler stack temperature and combustion efficiency measurements, showing efficiency drop from 82% to 76% as excess air increases").

## Practice Questions

Download the [$\LaTeX$ template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/pptdzcvvzxvt#52d360) to complete these practice problems. 

### Question 1: Eliminating Passive Voice

The following paragraph contains excessive passive voice that weakens the recommendation. Rewrite it using active voice where appropriate, while preserving passive voice only where it serves a legitimate purpose.

**Original paragraph:**

"During the assessment, measurements were taken of the compressed air system pressure. It was observed that pressure levels were being maintained at 120 psi, though the equipment requirements were determined to be only 90 psi. It is estimated that energy consumption could be reduced by approximately 18% if the pressure setpoint was lowered. A recommendation is made that the pressure be reduced to 95 psi, which would provide a 5 psi safety margin. Annual savings of $8,400 would be achieved through this measure."

**Task:** Rewrite this paragraph to eliminate unnecessary passive voice. Your revised version should be stronger and more direct while maintaining technical accuracy.

### Question 2: Replacing Vague Language with Precision

The following paragraph uses vague qualifiers and imprecise language that undermines its credibility. Rewrite it with specific numbers and concrete details.

**Original paragraph:**

"The facility's lighting system is quite old and uses a significant amount of energy. Many of the fixtures are outdated technology that is much less efficient than modern alternatives. Upgrading to newer lighting would result in substantial energy savings and a considerable reduction in maintenance costs. The payback period would likely be relatively short, making this a good investment for the facility. There are also some additional benefits such as improved light quality and reduced heat output."

**Given information for your rewrite:**

- The facility has 240 T8 fluorescent fixtures in the production area

- Current lighting power: 67 kW

- Proposed LED lighting power: 31 kW

- Annual operating hours: 5,200 hours

- Electricity rate: $0.11/kWh

- Implementation cost after rebates: $28,000

- Maintenance cost reduction: $1,800/year (eliminated lamp and ballast replacements)

**Task:** Rewrite this paragraph using the specific information provided. Replace all vague language with precise numbers and concrete details.

### Question 3: Writing Figure Captions

Download [this file](../../assets/Module-3/Question-3-Data.csv) showing the late fees on electricity bills for a facility.  

**Part A:** Insert the data table into your document using booktabs formatting. 

**Part B:** Create a graph of the data. Insert this graph into your document and provide a strong caption. 

**Part C:** Write a paragraph discussing the late fees that references the table adn figure.
