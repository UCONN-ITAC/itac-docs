# Conclusion

## Module Summary

This module covered compressed air systems, which account for 5-20% of industrial electricity consumption yet are often the most poorly managed energy system in manufacturing facilities. Understanding supply-side efficiency, distribution losses, and demand-side waste allows you to identify savings opportunities of 20-50% with relatively simple improvements.

### Key Takeaways

**Life Cycle Economics:** Energy costs dominate compressed air system economics, accounting for 73% of total life cycle cost. The energy cost exceeds the initial purchase price within 12 months of operation. This means operating efficiency matters far more than initial equipment cost.

**Compressor Types and Controls:** Reciprocating compressors offer efficient on/off operation for smaller, intermittent loads. Rotary screw compressors dominate larger applications but waste 50-60% of full-load power when unloaded. Variable speed drives eliminate unloaded waste for varying loads. Lead-lag control strategies optimize multiple-compressor systems.

**Air Dryers:** Refrigerated dryers achieve 35-40°F dew points, adequate for most applications. Desiccant dryers reach -40°F or lower but cost more to operate (unless waste heat is available for regeneration). Only dry air that needs drying—don't waste energy drying air for applications that tolerate moisture.

**Pressure Drop:** Pressure drop varies with the inverse fifth power of pipe diameter, meaning small undersizing creates enormous energy waste. Every 1 psig of distribution pressure drop increases compressor energy by approximately 0.5%. Target total distribution pressure drop under 5 psi. Receivers provide storage capacity, stabilize pressure, and collect condensate.

**Supply-Side Opportunities:** The single biggest opportunity is reducing system pressure—every 2 psig reduction saves approximately 1% energy. Intake air temperature matters (1% savings per 5°F reduction). Heat recovery from compressor exhaust can offset facility heating costs.

**Demand-Side Waste:** Only 45% of compressed air performs useful production work. Leaks (20-30%), inappropriate uses (10%), and artificial demand (15%) account for the remainder. Leaks cost approximately $80-100 per CFM per year. FRL devices account for 46% of all leaks due to their prevalence and multiple connection points.

**Appropriate vs. Inappropriate Uses:** Compressed air is 7-8 times more expensive than electricity per unit of energy delivered. Pneumatic tools, actuators, and specialized applications (air knives, spray painting, blow molding) are appropriate. Personal cooling, continuous blow-off, and air motors (except in hazardous environments) are inappropriate and should be replaced with fans, blowers, or electric motors.

**Leak Management:** Effective leak management requires continuous vigilance, not one-time fixes. Best practice achieves leakage under 10% of system capacity. Systematic measurement (shutdown tests, ultrasonic surveys) identifies leaks. Tagging, repair tracking, and performance metrics sustain programs.

## Practice Questions

Where applicable, determine savings by comparing a baseline case to an "efficient" case. 

### Question 1: Compressor System Analysis

A facility operates a 100 HP rotary screw compressor producing 400 CFM at 100 psig. The compressor runs 6,000 hours per year. During a recent assessment, you observed the following:

- System pressure at compressor discharge: 100 psig
- Pressure at furthest end use: 85 psig
- Compressor cycles between loaded and unloaded every 4 minutes
- Load time: 2.5 minutes, Unload time: 1.5 minutes per cycle
- Measured leakage: 50 CFM

Electricity costs $0.12/kWh. The compressor draws 75 kW when loaded and 40 kW when unloaded.

**Part A:** Calculate the percentage of time the compressor spends loaded vs. unloaded.

**Part B:** Calculate annual electricity cost for the compressor under current operation.

**Part C:** If leaks were reduced to 20 CFM (best practice of 5% of capacity), estimate the percentage reduction in compressor runtime and annual savings. Assume the compressor would still cycle but with longer unload periods.

**Part D:** The facility is considering a VFD retrofit to eliminate unloaded operation. Estimate annual energy savings if the VFD allows the compressor to reduce speed during periods that currently run unloaded, reducing power consumption to 25 kW during those periods.

### Question 2: Pressure Drop and System Optimization

A facility has a 500-foot compressed air distribution line running from the compressor room to a remote production area. Current pipe size is 2" diameter, and pressure drop is measured at 20 psi from compressor to end use.

The facility runs a 150 HP compressor at 105 psig discharge pressure to ensure 85 psig at the remote end use. The compressor operates 8,000 hours per year at an average of 70% load. Electricity costs $0.14/kWh.

**Part A:** Using the rule of thumb that every 2 psig pressure increase costs 1% more energy, calculate annual energy cost penalty from the 20 psi pressure drop.

**Part B:** The facility considers replacing the 2" line with a 4" line. If pressure drop varies with the inverse fifth power of diameter, what would be the new pressure drop with 4" pipe?

**Part C:** With 4" pipe, the compressor discharge pressure could be reduced to what amount (85 psig needed + new pressure drop)? Calculate annual energy savings from this pressure reduction.

**Part D:** The 4" pipe costs $25/foot installed. Calculate simple payback period for the piping upgrade.

### Question 3: Inappropriate Use Replacement

During an assessment, you identify three inappropriate compressed air uses:

- Continuous blow-off nozzle keeping dust off a product on a conveyor. Operates 24/7, consuming 15 CFM at 90 psig.

- Compressed air nozzle acting as a personal cooling fan used by an operator at a hot workstation. Operates 2,000 hours per year, consuming 20 CFM at 90 psig.

- 5 HP air motor driving a mixer that runs continuously (4,000 hours/year). Air motor consumes 20 CFM per HP at 90 psig.

The facility operates a 100 HP compressor at 100 psig. Assume that compressed air costs $0.25 per 1,000 ft³ (or equivalently, each CFM costs approximately $90/year at 6,000 operating hours and $0.12/kWh).

**Part A:** Calculate annual cost for each inappropriate use.

**Part B:** The blow-off application (Use #1) can be replaced with a 250W electric blower costing $600 installed. Calculate simple payback.

**Part C:** Personal cooling (Use #2) can be addressed with a $75 portable fan consuming 50W. Calculate simple payback.

**Part D:** The air motor (Use #3) can be replaced with a 5 HP electric motor (90% efficiency) costing $1,200 installed. Calculate annual operating cost of the electric motor and simple payback for replacement.
