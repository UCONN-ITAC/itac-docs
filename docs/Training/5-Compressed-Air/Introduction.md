# Introduction

Compressed air is often called the "fourth utility" alongside electricity, natural gas, and water. In manufacturing facilities, compressed air powers pneumatic tools, actuates machinery, moves products through production lines, and performs countless other tasks. Despite its ubiquity, compressed air is frequently the most inefficient and poorly managed energy system in a plant.

Between 5% and 20% of industrial electricity consumption goes toward compressed air generation, representing approximately $1.5 billion in annual costs across U.S. manufacturing. The combination of high costs and poor attention to performance creates extraordinary opportunities for energy savings. Improvements of 20-50% are common with relatively simple fixes.

## Why Compressed Air Is So Inefficient

Compressed air is expensive to produce because the compression process itself is thermodynamically inefficient. For every unit of energy delivered as compressed air to the end use, approximately seven to eight units of electrical energy must be input at the compressor. Most of this energy is lost as heat during compression.

Despite this poor efficiency, compressed air remains valuable because:
- Pneumatic tools are lighter and more compact than electric equivalents
- Compressed air provides precise control over speed and torque
- There are no electrical shock hazards in wet or hazardous environments
- Actuators can deliver smooth, controlled motion in tight spaces

## The Compressed Air System

A complete compressed air system consists of three main components:

1. **Supply side (Air Compressors):** Where atmospheric air is compressed to system pressure. This includes the compressor itself, air dryers, filters, and controls.

2. **Distribution system:** The network of pipes, receivers (storage tanks), and valves that deliver compressed air throughout the facility.

3. **Demand side (End Uses):** The tools, actuators, and processes that consume compressed air.

Understanding all three components is essential for identifying savings opportunities. Supply-side issues (compressor type, controls, drying) determine baseline efficiency. Distribution issues (leaks, pressure drop) waste energy between generation and use. Demand-side issues (inappropriate uses, inefficient tools) create unnecessary load.

## Module Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

- Understand how different compressor types work and when each is appropriate
- Identify supply-side efficiency opportunities (control strategies, intake air, heat recovery)
- Recognize how pressure drop affects system energy consumption
- Calculate the cost of air leaks and inappropriate uses
- Apply the affinity laws to estimate compressed air system savings
- Distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate compressed air applications
- Develop comprehensive compressed air recommendations for ITAC assessments


Throughout the module, we'll emphasize a critical principle: **compressed air is not free**!!! Every cubic foot of compressed air represents significant electrical cost, and treating it as a valuable resource drives all efficiency improvements.
