# Conclusion

## Module 2 Summary

This module covered the fundamentals of AC power, including the distinction between real, reactive, and apparent power, and the concept of power factor. You learned how three-phase systems differ from single-phase and why they dominate industrial applications. We examined electric motors as the primary energy consumers in most facilities, with attention to efficiency ratings, load factor effects, and the transformative potential of variable frequency drives. Finally, we explored belt drive systems as the critical link between electrical and mechanical energy, comparing V-belts and synchronous belts and understanding the efficiency implications of each.

In the next module, you will apply these electrical and mechanical concepts to more complex systems: compressed air, boilers and steam, chillers, and HVAC. The motor and belt knowledge from this module will be directly relevant as you analyze these motor-driven thermal and fluid systems.



## Review Questions

1. A three-phase 480V system has a line current of 50A and a power factor of 0.85. Calculate the real power, reactive power, and apparent power.

2. A facility has a peak demand of 500 kW with a power factor of 0.78. The utility charges by kVA instead of kW when the power factor is below 90%. The facility's average demand rate is $19.50 per kW-month. Calculate the monthly penalty cost and the kVAR of capacitors needed to eliminate it.

3. Explain why an oversized motor operates at lower efficiency and lower power factor than a properly sized motor carrying the same load.

4. A centrifugal fan is currently running at full speed with a damper 60% closed to control airflow. Estimate the power savings if the damper were fully opened and a VFD controlled speed to achieve the same airflow.

5. A 25 HP motor runs 8,000 hours per year driving a conveyor through a V-belt system that is 5 years old and showing signs of wear. Current belt efficiency is estimated at 93%. Calculate the annual energy cost savings of converting to synchronous belts at 98% efficiency, assuming electricity costs $0.12/kWh.

## Recommendation Project

A facility is currently operating 5 identical manufacturing lines. Each line contains a 90% efficient 50 hp motor that drives a machine through a standard V-belt. From the onsite assessment, it was identified that the actual load on the motor is 20 HP. Each line operates for 2000 hours each year. 

Requirements: 

1. Create a recommendation for replacing the motor with a properly-sized unit. 

2. Create a recommendation for changing the standard V-belt to a notched V-belt at the next time where it's required to change the belt. 

3. Create a recommendation for changing the motor for a higher efficiency variant. 


!!! note

    You should reference the relevant recommendation tutorial pages while completing this. They will be quite helpful. 

Given Assumptions: 

- Cost of a standard V-belt is $50 less than that of a notched V-belt

- Utility rates are $0.18 per kWh and $18.50 per kW-month

- Motor replacements require 4 hours of labor at $100/hour

- Replacement motor costs are given by this table:

| HP | Standard Efficiency (90%) | Premium Efficiency (95%) |
|-----|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| 10 | $800 | $1,200 |
| 25 | $1,400 | $1,900 |
| 50 | $2,250 | $3,100 |
| 100 | $4,500 | $6,200 |

(These are sample numbers for a simplified scenario. Do not use these numbers for actual recommendations.)
