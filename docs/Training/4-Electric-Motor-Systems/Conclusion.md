# Conclusion

## Module Summary

This module covered electric motor systems, the dominant energy consumer in most industrial facilities. You learned how electric motors convert electrical energy to mechanical work, how the affinity laws explain the dramatic energy savings available from VFDs, and how to analyze pumping systems and belt drives for efficiency opportunities.

### Key Takeaways

**Electric Motors:** Induction motors dominate industrial applications due to their simplicity and reliability. Motor efficiency varies with load, with peak efficiency typically occurring between 75-100% of rated load. Oversized motors operate at lower efficiency and lower power factor. When motors fail, replacement with properly-sized premium efficiency units often pays back quickly.

**Affinity Laws:** For centrifugal fans and pumps, flow is proportional to speed, pressure to speed squared, and power to speed cubed. This cubic relationship is why reducing speed by 20% cuts power by nearly 50%. The affinity laws are the foundation for understanding VFD energy savings.

**VFDs and Soft Starters:** VFDs control motor speed by varying frequency, enabling dramatic energy savings on variable-load applications. Soft starters reduce starting current and mechanical stress but provide no ongoing speed control. VFDs are appropriate when flow varies; soft starters when constant speed is acceptable but reduced starting stress is valuable.

**Pumps:** Centrifugal pumps follow the affinity laws, making them excellent VFD candidates. System curves (static head + friction head) intersect with pump curves to determine the operating point. Pumps should operate near their best efficiency point (BEP) for optimal performance. Oversized pumps require throttling or bypass, wasting energy.

**Belts:** V-belts are common but have efficiency of 90-95%. Notched V-belts improve to 95-97%. Synchronous belts achieve 98% efficiency and eliminate slip. Belt upgrades often pay back quickly on motors that run many hours per year.

## Practice Questions

1. A three-phase 480V system has a line current of 50A and a power factor of 0.85. Calculate the real power, reactive power, and apparent power.

2. Explain why an oversized motor operates at lower efficiency and lower power factor than a properly sized motor carrying the same load.

3. A chilled water pump runs at constant speed with a throttle valve partially closed. The pump delivers 400 GPM but is rated for 600 GPM. The motor draws 30 kW. Using the affinity laws, estimate the power consumption if a VFD were installed to deliver 400 GPM without throttling.

4. A facility operates a 50 HP motor driving a centrifugal fan. The load profile is: 100% flow for 2,000 hr/yr, 80% flow for 3,000 hr/yr, 60% flow for 3,000 hr/yr. Current power consumption is 40 kW at 100% flow. Calculate the annual energy savings from installing a VFD.

5. A pump system has 20 feet of static head and friction losses of 30 feet at 500 GPM design flow. If a VFD reduces flow to 400 GPM, estimate the new friction head (hint: friction varies with flow squared) and explain why the total system head doesn't decrease proportionally with flow.

## Recommendation Project

A facility is currently operating 5 identical manufacturing lines. Each line contains a 90% efficient 50 HP motor that drives a machine through a standard V-belt. From the onsite assessment, it was identified that the actual load on the motor is 20 HP. Each line operates for 2,000 hours each year.

Requirements:

1. Create a recommendation for replacing the motor with a properly-sized unit of the same efficiency. 

2. Create a recommendation for changing the standard V-belt to a notched V-belt at the next time where it's required to change the belt.

3. Create a recommendation for changing the motor for a higher efficiency variant with the original HP.

!!! note

    You should reference the relevant recommendation tutorial pages while completing this. They will be quite helpful.

Given Assumptions:

- Cost of a standard V-belt is $50 less than that of a notched V-belt

- Utility rates are $0.18 per kWh and $18.50 per kW-month

- Motor replacements require 4 hours of labor at $100/hour

- Replacement motor costs are given by this table:

| HP | Minimum Code Requirement (90%) | Premium Efficiency (95%) |
|-----|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| 10 | $800 | $1,200 |
| 25 | $1,400 | $1,900 |
| 50 | $2,250 | $3,100 |
| 100 | $4,500 | $6,200 |

(These are sample numbers for a simplified scenario. Do not use these numbers for actual recommendations.)
