# Introduction

This module builds on the electrical fundamentals from Module 1, focusing specifically on motor-driven systems. Electric motors account for 60-70% of industrial electricity consumption, making them critical targets for energy efficiency improvements.

Here, you'll learn how electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical work, how the affinity laws govern the behavior of fans and pumps, why Variable Frequency Drives (VFDs) are such powerful energy-saving tools, and how mechanical power gets transmitted through belt systems.

The module follows a logical progression:
1. **Electric Motors:** Types, efficiency classes, and proper sizing
2. **Affinity Laws:** The physics that explains VFD energy savings
3. **VFDs and Soft Starters:** How to control motor speed and when each technology is appropriate
4. **Pumps:** System design, efficiency, and applications to energy assessment
5. **Belts and Transmission:** Mechanical losses between motors and driven equipment

By the end of this module, you should be able to analyze motor-driven systems from the electrical input all the way through to the mechanical output, identify VFD opportunities, and quantify energy savings potential.
